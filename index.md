### About Me
I am a M.S. student in [Natural Language Processing Group (NLP) group](https://nlp.postech.ac.kr/), working with [Prof. Gary Geunbae Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t30saScAAAAJ&hl) at POSTECH. My primary research interest lies in reasoning, particularly in code generation. I aim to enhance interactive reasoning agents through human collaboration.

Beyond reasoning agents, my research interests extend to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and question-answering in the medical domain. I am particularly captivated by the challenge of facilitating human interaction.

Previously, I completed my B.S. in School of Electrical Engineering at Hanyang University ERICA.
