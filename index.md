### About
I am a researcher in Machine Learning.

I am currently a research intern at [NAVER Cloud](https://www.ncloud.com/). Before joining the team, I received an M.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence at POSTECH, where I worked with [Prof. Gary Geunbae Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/gary-geunbae-lee/) and [Prof. Hyounghun Kim](https://hyounghk.github.io/) in the [Natural Language Processing Group](https://nlp.postech.ac.kr/). Previously, I completed a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering at Hanyang University ERICA.

My current research focuses on reasoning (e.g., mathematics and coding) and self-evolving AI.
